# ChatON

This basic firabase based chat app is part of an android project for the university.
It allows people to connect to the app using a name and an e-mail, and then to chat with all the people who has this app.

## Getting Started

You just need to clone the project copy up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

It should work on any recent smartphone, anyway this project has only been tested on my Samsung S7 running Android 7.0 Nougat.
There could be some problems with other Android operating system.
