# ChatON

This basic firabase based chat app is part of an android project for the university.
It allows people to connect to the app using a name and an e-mail, and then to chat with all the people who has this app.

## Getting Started

You just need to clone the project copy up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Even if it is a private project, feel free to contribute to this application (fork and make a pull request).

This project has been tested on my Samsung S7 running Android 7.0 Nougat.
There could be some problems with other Android operating system.
